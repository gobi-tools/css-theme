Improvements
------------
- [ ] if I have a nav with the "card" role, it looks fairly ok; but the padding-block could be 0 to make it look even better
- [ ] fieldsets, cards all have padding-bottom: 0 -> is that a good way to approach this? or is it better to have the same padding as top/left/right and figure out a way to remove buttons, inputs, etc natural bottom padding if they are the last element? 
- [ ] decide on class-based versions for various roles & types (columns, note, etc)
- [ ] redo the horizontal spacing to be based on "ch"
- [ ] redo the mobile & container logic (based on "ch", like here: https://www.zolkos.com/2025/12/03/vanilla-css-is-all-you-need)

Bugs
----
- [ ] on mobile Chrome (browser), submit & reset input types have left-aligned text, instead of centered 
- [ ] on mobile Chrome (browser), datepicker has small height & width
- [ ] on smaller devices (any browswer) grouped select + datepicker + button ... the select input becoems waaaay to small 
- [ ] for menu elements on smaller devices, when I have 5 navigation menu tabs, the last one won't appear and the widths are not consistent
- [ ] buttons or submit inputs as direct parents inside a "row" role should not have margin-left between them anymore (on desktop or mobile)
- [ ] checkbox & radio button text is not correctly aligned (it needs more padding bottom?)
- [ ] ordered lists should also have the same v-spacing as horizontal lists
- [ ] if datalist is last element in a grouped form, then one of the visible inputs will not have the right-hand side border
- [ ] buttons with icon & text need better horizontal alignment
- [ ] when in a form/fieldset and I want to "group" inputs
  - [ ] they still have a margin-left between them 
  - [ ] they are not 100% of the screen
- [x] code, kbd, etc, elements should have display: inline-block
- [x] make the .is-gap class not visible on mobile
