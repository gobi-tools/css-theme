Features
--------

- [x] navigation
  - [ ] navigation of various widths (super skinny, skinny, horizontal, etc, like the side menu of CircleCI)

Improvements
------------
- [x] if I have a nav with the "card" role, it looks fairly ok; but the padding-block could be 0 to make it look even better
- [ ] fieldsets, cards all have padding-bottom: 0 
  -> is that a good way to approach this? or is it better to have the same padding as top/left/right and figure out a way to remove buttons, inputs, etc natural bottom padding if they are the last element? 
- [ ] decide on class-based versions for various roles & types (columns, note, etc)
- [ ] redo the horizontal spacing to be based on "ch"
- [ ] redo aside and any other fixed widths to be based on "ch"
- [ ] redo the mobile & container logic (based on "ch", like here: https://www.zolkos.com/2025/12/03/vanilla-css-is-all-you-need)
- [ ] change "mobile & desktop" only class naming to something like:
 - .is-mobile-only --> .is-mobile-visible (?)
 - .is-desktop-only --> .is-desktop-visible (?)
 - .no-mobile --> .is-desktop-only
- [ ] for Tab like navigation, is it possible to have N layers, like Soda docs
  https://docs.soda.io/data-testing/git-managed-data-contracts/install-and-configure 

Bugs
----
- [ ] form elements (textarea, inputs) in a couple of layouts (http://localhost/docs/forms-normal?theme=default&width=medium) 
      on smaller devices (but not yet mobile) are not aligning correclty (e.g. 782px)
        - [x] fixed for http://localhost/docs/forms-normal?theme=default&width=medium at 782px
        - [ ] still a problem here, http://localhost/docs/forms-grouped?theme=default&width=medium, at 806px
- [ ] autocompleted input elements (name, email, etc) have a "yellow" background; can it be changed?
- [ ] for menu elements on smaller devices, when I have 5 navigation menu tabs, the last one won't appear and the widths are not consistent
- [x] if datalist is last element in a grouped form, then one of the visible inputs will not have the right-hand side border
- [x] Tabs in here http://localhost/docs/tabs?theme=default&width=medium at 1000px does not look great (e.g. they're going mobile way too soon!)
- [x] when in a form/fieldset and I want to "group" inputs
  - [x] they still have a margin-left between them 
  - [x] they are not 100% of the screen
- [x] buttons or submit inputs as direct parents inside a "row" role should not have margin-left between them anymore (on desktop or mobile)
- [x] buttons with icon & text need better horizontal alignment
- [x] if a set of grouped checkboxes aren't each in their div (label + input pair), then v-align is way off
- [x] checkbox & radio button text is not correctly aligned (it needs more padding bottom?)
- [x] ordered lists should also have the same v-spacing as horizontal lists
- [x] on mobile, make sure no zooming happens on input focus (this is because input font was smaller than 16px!)
- [x] on smaller devices (any browswer) grouped select + datepicker + button ... the select input becoems waaaay to small horizontally whilst other elements maintain a decent width
- [x] on mobile Chrome (browser), datepicker has small height & width
- [x] on mobile Chrome (browser), submit & reset input types have left-aligned text, instead of centered 
- [x] code, kbd, etc, elements should have display: inline-block
- [x] make the .is-gap class not visible on mobile
