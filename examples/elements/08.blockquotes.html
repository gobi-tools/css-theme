          <p>
            Last time I ran a huge experiment trying to figure out how components should work in Humble UI. Since then,
            I’ve been trying to bring it to the main.
          </p>

            This was trickier than I anticipated — even with a working prototype, there are still lots of decisions to
            make, and each one takes time.
